## TeamCode Core

Welcome!

This module, Core, **is shared between the two operational modes** and is for the core components and functions of the bot
This is all related to custom written functions designed to be used in the other two operations and **should be clearly documented or atleast readable**

#### ie.
- drive train
- sensors
- motors
- servos
- and anything used in the init phase should probably be included unless better judgement proves otherwise
